            <hr />
            <p>Sales Tracker is a next-generation Sales management SaaS platform designed for tracking Sales performance and Talent management of the company. It cater to the needs of the companies to keep a track on the sales of the companies.</p>
            <p>The software tracks the performance of sales person with the sales revenue generated by him. The software graphs the statistics of the sales ranging from highest earning to lowest earning. The software allows to award the sales person and on the other hand also notifies him for his sales.</p>
            <p>The Idea came while eating at Mcdonald’s on the campus. The Shop had the Performance board drawn on the white board showcasing ‘Employee of the month’ Award. The Manger has to look across various traits and keep a track on every salesperson manually to grade his performance. This couls All be Automated. We brainstormed it further to not change the process but make it simple to use for every manager at large and small SME’s.Ironically, The Mcdonalds is one of our customers</p>
